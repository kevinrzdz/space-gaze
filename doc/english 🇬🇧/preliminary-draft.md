### Problem description

Often, astronomy is seen as a discipline exclusive to experts and academics, and its relevance to the general public is underestimated.

However, astronomy is fundamental to understanding our place in the universe, our evolution as a species, and the impact our actions can have on the environment and other living beings.

In addition, astronomy is also key to technological development and space exploration, areas that have a great impact on our economy and the daily lives of people.

### Objectives

The project was conceived with the aim of promoting public interest in astronomy and related areas, providing reliable and engaging content that highlights the latest research and discoveries in this field. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, encouraging visitors to explore and learn more about the universe we live in.

Through this initiative, Space Gaze aims to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among the scientific community in general, as well as facilitate the participation and understanding of the general public in the fascinating field of astronomy.

### Architecture and technologies to be used

The website will have the following functionalities (preliminary):

- Show detailed information about different celestial bodies.
- Allow users to search and filter information.
- Provide a calendar of astronomical events, such as eclipses, planetary alignments, and meteor showers.
- A detailed 3d viewer of the Milky Way and all the bodies in it (provided by https://www.solarsystemscope.com/)

The technologies used will be:

- HTML for the structure.
- CSS and SASS for the styling.
- Javascript and Typescript with Angular for the Front end.
- Java with Spring for the Back end.
- MySQL database.
